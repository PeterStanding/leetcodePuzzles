Hi there 👋

This is all the code I have used to solve the LeetCode Puzzles

My aim is to see the development of my coding and how I think about the puzzles

Originally I aim to solve the problems in Java first then Translate the solution across to Python after

There are definitely more streamlined versions of the solutions with better time complexity

If I find the solution that is better, I shall take a copy of it an reference the original Coder with their Leetcode Name and completion date
